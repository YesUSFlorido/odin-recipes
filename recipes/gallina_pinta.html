      <p>Gallina pinta its odd. First, its  named literally translates to “Painted Chicken” even though its a beef soup. Secondly, nobody really knows why its called like that…</p>
     
      <p>There's a story that say some cowboys got together and made a soup out of the things they had at hand (this being: beans, maize and beef); after putting the ingredients 
         in the pot a chicken started jumping around it, making the cowboys yell: “¡Aguas con la Gallina Pinta!”; making everyone believe that was the name of the soup.</p>

      <p>But perhaps the name comes from the color the beans and maize make on the soup, however that doesn’t explain where does the chicken comes from…</p>

      <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

      <p>Some of the ingredients needed are:</p>

     <ul>

     <h2>Steps:</h2>
