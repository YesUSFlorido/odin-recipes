    <title>Gallina Pinta</title>

     <p>Gallina pinta its odd. First its  named literally translates to “Painted Chicken” even though its a beef soup. Secondly, nobody really knows why its called like that…</p>
     <p>theres a story that says some cowboys got together and made a soup out of the things they had (this being: beans, maize and beef); after putting the ingredients in the pot
        a chicken started jumping around it, making the cowboys yell: “¡Aguas con la Gallina Pinta!”; making everyone believe that was the name of the soup.</p>

     <p>Other theory suggest that perhaps the name comes from the color that the beans and maize make on the soup, however that doesn’t explain where the chicken comes from…</p>
