        <p>Here in my country state; Sonora, chile colorado its quite easy to make; however not
        every state (let alone every country) uses the same type of peppers. Many don't know this,
        but there are a lot of variants of peppers and many of those are not spicy at all. Anaheim
        its one and the star of this recipe!</p>

        <p>Usually there are several hundred types of chiles and almost every type looks
        almost the same, however the one we are using its called "Red Dry Anaheim Peppers".
        its used quite a lot in the state of Sonora for this very sauce; they are called "chiles verdes"
        and when they are red and dried are called "chile colorado", frequently confused
        with "Guajillo" peppers and, although both of them are fantastic, they are not the same since.</p>

        <p>chile colorado sauce its just another type of ingredient that can be use
        in other dishes, such as: whole or refried beans, gallina pinta, enchiladas, etc.</p>
                
        <p>You could experiment a little with it, maybe its good with smash potatoes!</p>

        <h1>Ingredient:</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>red dried chiles anaheim</li>
            <li>water</li>
            <li>garlic cloves</li>
            <li>oil or fat</li>
            <li>salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Steps:</h1>
        <p></p>
        <ol>
        <li>
                First you need to cut the tails of the peppers, cutting them
                with sissors will do the work; then you have get rid of the 
                pepper's seeds. This is only to make it more easy to blend so
                you don't have to be that rigourous. 
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
                Once you are done you can just put them inside a pot and boil
                boil them until the peppers are soft and tender.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
                After boiling; you need to wait for the peppers to cool off,
                while you wait you can peel the garlic cloves.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>if the peppers are cool off and the cloves are good to go,
                you now have to blend both the cloves and the peppers until
                the peppers liquify.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>That's pretty much it! You will need to add salt depending on your taste.</li>
        </ol>
