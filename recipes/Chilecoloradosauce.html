    <p>Here in my country state; Sonora, chile colorado its quite easy to make; however not
every state (let alone every country) uses the same type of peppers. Many dont know this,
but there are a lot of variants of peppers and many of those are not spicy at all. Anaheim
its one and the star of this recipe!</p>

<p>Usually there are several hundred types of chiles and almost every type looks
almost the same, however the one we are using its called "Red Dry Anaheim Peppers".
its used quite a lot in the state of Sonora for this very sauce; they are called "chiles verdes"
and when they are red and dried are called "chile colorado", frequently confuse
with "Guajillo" peppers and, although both of them are fantastic, they are not the same since
Guajillo can be more spicy.</p>

<p>chile colorado sauce its just another type of ingredient that can be use
in other dishes, such as: whole or refried beans, gallina pinta, enchiladas, etc.</p>
        
<p>You could experiment a little with it, maybe its good with smash potatoes!</p>
