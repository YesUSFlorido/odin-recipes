Odin Project: Recipes.

This project is to show what I currently learned about html and web
development. This project should prove that I understand the fundamentals
of html and related topics such as:

	-Basic understanding about Git and Github.
	-Edit text, links and images using the basics of html

The recipes will not show certain dishes very accurately since thats not really the purpose for this project
however i will try to make it more like a decent recipes website once im done with the fundamentals
